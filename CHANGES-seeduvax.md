## Version seeduvax-2.6

* forked from vinniefalco's 2.6

### seeduvax#1: compilation switch to disable stack specialization for int

Some users need a specific alternate stack specialization to deal with int64
types and manage compatiblit√© with both luatjit and pre lua 5.1 and post lua 5.1

### seeduvax#2: enable additional index/newindex methods for a C++ class tree

Introduced to let C++ object implementing a named composite pattern to bind its
component hierarchy in the lua space, letting the user walk the component
hierarchy using the dot operator like in any lua table.
May be also a way to solve issue [#197][I197]
